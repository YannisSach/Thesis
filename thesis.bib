abstract="Partial-order verification methods exploit ``independency'' between transitions of a concurrent program to avoid parts of the state space explosion due to the modeling of concurrency by interleaving. In this paper, we study the influence of refining dependencies between transitions of the program on the effectiveness of these methods. We show that carefully tracking dependencies can yield substantial improvements for their performances. For instance, we were able to decrease the memory requirements needed for the verification of a real-size protocol with such a method from a factor of 5 to a factor of 25 by only refining dependencies.",

abstract="Partial order reduction has traditionally been based on persistent sets, ample sets, stubborn sets, or variants thereof. Recently, we have presented a strengthening of this foundation, using source sets instead of persistent/ample/stubborn sets. Source sets subsume persistent sets and are often smaller than persistent sets. We introduced source sets as a basis for Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR), in a framework which assumes that processes are deterministic and that all program executions are finite. In this paper, show how to use source sets for partial order reduction in a framework which does not impose these restrictions. We also compare source sets with persistent sets, providing some insights into conditions under which source sets and persistent sets do or do not differ.",

abstract="With the advancement of computer technology, highly concurrent systems are being developed. The verification of such systems is a challenging task, as their state space grows exponentially with the number of processes. Partial order reduction is an effective technique to address this problem. It relies on the observation that the effect of executing transitions concurrently is often independent of their ordering. In this paper we present the basic principles behind partial order reduction and its implementation.",
